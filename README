The pique package is a high efficiency peak finder for ChIP-seq
experiments that yield high coverage allignments to the reference
genome. It was developed for studying gene expression in Halobacterium
salinarum sp. NRC1, sequenced using barcoded 40bp Illumina reads as
part of an ongoing project in Marc Facciotti's lab at UC Davis.
