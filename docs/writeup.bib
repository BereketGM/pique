    abstract = {{SUMMARY: The Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) format is a
generic alignment format for storing read alignments against reference
sequences, supporting short and long reads (up to 128 Mbp) produced by
different sequencing platforms. It is flexible in style, compact in
size, efficient in random access and is the format in which alignments
from the 1000 Genomes Project are released. SAMtools implements
various utilities for post-processing alignments in the SAM format,
such as indexing, variant caller and alignment viewer, and thus
provides universal tools for processing read alignments. AVAILABILITY:
